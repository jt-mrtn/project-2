# project-2
## Portfolio Website -
This is the first website I've created for a public audience. It was begun in partial fulfillment of Thinkful's Software Engineering certification program. I've since moved on to other things.

Recently I completed a course in creative coding for the visual arts and have included some of my work on the Projects page.

This site contains the following pages:
* Home
* About
* Projects (with links to other pages)
* Contact

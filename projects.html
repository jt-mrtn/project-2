      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>So far, I've managed to venture into wide screen territory only. These first projects are exercises in responsiveness with
         the cursor, specifically using the mouse. So, if you're on a mobile device at the moment, I apologize. I will be focusing
        on smaller screens in due time. </p>

        <p>Throughout time we've asked ouselves: what came first, the chicken or the egg? There are
        so many facets to that question. So much so, it's like a cultural diamond in the rough.</p>
         
        <p>I've taken this age-old quandry and explored its imagery â€“ but more specifically, how the golden ratio is 
        the driver with its mysterious, ever-present, Fibanacci-sequence engine incessantly asserting itself into 
        our lives.</p> 

        <p>Another shape similar in form is the human eye. Like chicken eggs, and along with its lids and lashes, the width is 
        about 1.6 times the height, on average. I don't think The Beatles had this in mind when they
        wrote <em>Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds</em> but they did talk about

        <p>Similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slit-scan_photography" target="\_blank" title="Open separate page for
           slit scanning wikipedia article">slip-scan photography</a>, JavaScript can transform images by taking a
           column of pixels and reproduce them elsewhere. The effect is a smear of whatever color(s) happen to be hanging out in
           that column.</p>
           
        <p>I've used this technique to form a moving background to <a href = "projects/draceana/index.html" target="\_blank"
          title="Open separate page for Dracaena">a collage</a> with a dragon-like font, which I think is appropriate to
          accompany images of draceana, aka the dragon tree.</p>

        <p>Click any mouse button to see things a different way. There's a line to assist with your slip-scanning. The actual
          image being scanned is partially hidden but it is the repeated image you see I kid you not. </p>

        <p>This project is an exploration of nonlinear narrative programming logic. It's like a game, sort of. You can type words or 
          small phrases depending on where you'd like to go.

        <p>Fans of The Wizard of Oz will enjoy this little trip to the merry old land of <a href = "projects/oz/index.html" target="\_blank"
          title="Open separate page for Some of Oz">Oz</a>. As the title suggests, this is only some of the amazing fable that captured my
        imagination as a kid. You won't see any munchkins or Auntie Em, for example.</p>

        <p>I spent a little extra time exploring different treatments of typography, going as far as using rotation in a for loop
          to provide a descending arc of text. I hope you enjoy it!</p>

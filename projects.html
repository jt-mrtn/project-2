      <p>These are interactive, JavaScript programming excercises in responsiveness with the cursor, specifically using
         the mouse and/or keyboard. So far, I've managed to venture into wide screen territory only. If you are on a
         mobile device at the moment, I apologize. I'll focus on smaller screens in due time.</p>

        <p>Throughout time we've asked ouselves: what came first, the chicken or the egg? There are
        so many facets to that question. So much so, it's like a cultural diamond in the rough.</p>
         
        <p>I've taken this age-old quandry and explored its imagery – but more specifically, how the golden ratio is 
        the driver with its mysterious, ever-present, Fibanacci-sequence engine incessantly asserting itself into 
        our lives.</p> 

        <p>Another shape similar in form is the human eye. Like chicken eggs, and along with its lids and lashes, the width is 
        about 1.6 times the height, on average. I don't think The Beatles had this in mind when they
        wrote <em>Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds</em> but they did talk about

        <p>Similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slit-scan_photography" target="\_blank" title="Open separate page for
           slit scanning wikipedia article">slip-scan photography</a>, JavaScript can transform images by taking a
           column of pixels and reproduce them elsewhere. The effect is a smear of whatever color(s) happen to be hanging out in
           that column.</p>
           
        <p>I've used this technique to form a moving background to <a href = "projects/draceana/index.html" target="\_blank"
          title="Open separate page for Dracaena">a collage</a> with a dragon-like font, which I think is appropriate to
          accompany images of draceana, aka the dragon tree.</p>

        <p>Click any mouse button to see things a different way. There's a line to assist with your slip-scanning. The actual
          image being scanned is partially hidden but it is the repeated image you see I kid you not. </p>

        <p>This is an exploration of nonlinear, narrative, programming logic. It's like a game, sort of. You can type words or 
          small phrases depending on where you'd like to go.</p>
           
        <p>Fans of <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> will enjoy this little trip to that familiar <a href = "projects/oz/index.html" target="\_blank"
          title="Open separate page for Some of Oz">merry old land</a>. As the title suggests, this is only some of the amazing 
          fable that captured my imagination as a kid. You won't see any munchkins or Auntie Em, for example, but you might
          find yourself in the Witch's Castle. Oh my!</p>

        <p>I spent a little extra time exploring different treatments of typography, going as far as using an array in rotation 
          inside a for loop to build a descending arc of text. Enjoy!</p>

        <p><a href = "https://www.joaquin-rodrigo.com/index.php/en/" target="\_blank">Joaquín Rodrigo</a> (11/22/1901 – 7/6/1999) was a blind, spanish composer well-known for writing outstanding guitar music. 
          He also wrote an athletic flute concerto, <em>Concierto Pastoral</em>. It is one of the most difficult ever written for 
          the instrument. I chose a few bars of the energetic first movement for my first foray into audio visualization.</p>
           
        <p>Just 10 seconds with some reverb to give it an ethereal air, these <a href = "projects/rodrigo/index.html" target="\_blank"
          title="Open separate page for R-Viz">vivid colors and striking patterns</a> were driven by technical acrobatics in the music.
          This project is also a chance to show off my flute playing albeit many, many years ago. Betty Ann Diaz is also heard on piano. 
          Have a listen.</p>

          <p>Here's some more animation while I explore object-oriented programming, the superformula, and the superellipse.
            Yes, this did tax my brain!</p>
          <p>Did you play the lawn game croquet as a kid? I did and boy, did I have fun. I dove into my memory banks
            for this project and thought about my boyhood fascination with color (and Disney animation too). Afterall, that was my
            favorite part of the game, hitting those striped balls with colorfully designed mallets.
